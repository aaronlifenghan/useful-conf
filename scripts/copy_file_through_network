The recipient has to execute the command first.

The pv command can be skipped completely as it simply show
informations about how much data has been transmitted and
about the speed.

The commands are for the BSD version, the others might be
different.



Plain-text, ie, without cryptography:

Recipient:
$ netcat -l <PORT>  |  pv -btrap  |  tar xf -

Sender:
$ tar  cf -  --owner=0 --group=0   <FILENAME> [<FILENAME> ...] | pv -tbrap | netcat <IP-ADDRESS> <PORT>



With cryptography, of course the two passwords must be the same:

Recipient:
$ echo -n '<PASSWORD>' > ~/password.txt
$ netcat -l <PORT>  |  openssl aes-256-cbc -salt -d -pass file:~/password.txt  |  pv -btrap  |  tar xf -

Sender:
$ echo -n '<PASSWORD>' > ~/password.txt
$ tar cf -   --owner=0 --group=0   <FILENAME> [<FILENAME> ...]  |  openssl aes-256-cbc -salt -pass file:~/password.txt  |  pv -tbrap  |  netcat <IP-ADDRESS> <PORT>
